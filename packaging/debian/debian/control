Description: libfprint with Goodix GF511 (27c6:5110) fingerprint sensor driver
 libfprint is a library designed to make it easy for application developers
 to add support for consumer fingerprint readers.
 .
 This package replaces the official libfprint-2-2 to add a driver for the
 Goodix GF511 capacitive TLS fingerprint sensor (USB ID 27c6:5110), found in
 several Lenovo ThinkBook and IdeaPad laptops. The driver communicates over
 a TLS 1.2 PSK-DHE session (GnuTLS) and uses a pure-C FAST-9 + BRIEF-256
 keypoint matcher with no OpenSSL, OpenCV, or pthreads dependency.
